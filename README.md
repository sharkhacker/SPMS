According to the size of the vehicle, the Smart Parking Management System assigns the vehicle to the closest parking space to the entry after detecting the license plate number on the  given vehicle. There are several parking systems types that have been developed, including smart parking systems that use Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), but each of these approaches has its own benefits.

limitation. In addition, there are other issues with the present parking system, such as ineffective parking management. Consequently, it is suggested that the Smart Parking Management Systembe used to improve the effectiveness of the present parking management system. The consumer will be given the option to park close to the door thanks to this smart automated parking system. The parking is given based on the size of the vehicle that will be using the slot. Before permitting the car to enter the parking lot, the parking space is then shown on the monitor next to the boom gate. The motorist will not need to manually search the parking lot because the parking number and precise location will make it easier for them to locate a parking space quickly.

According to Dijkstra's Algorithm, the input signal from the entry camera and the hash lot matrix are processed to allocate the closest parking lot. In this project, the simulation is carried out utilizing the Dijkstra shortest path method and data collecting through machine learning. This simulation comprises finding the location of the closest parking lot and choosing the one that is the shortest. Hash lot matrix programming is used to determine the closest parking lot using Dijkstra's algorithm. In conclusion, real-time applications are possible for the Smart Parking Management System.
